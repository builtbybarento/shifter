Explanation:
Backend: You use Moment.js to handle date manipulation. The server calculates the days in the current month and checks for any events on each day. These events are then passed to the EJS template for rendering.
Frontend (EJS): The calendar grid is dynamically generated by looping through the days in the current month, displaying each dayâ€™s date and any events associated with it.
This approach will automatically generate a calendar view for the current month and allow you to render events dynamically without manually coding months.

Here's the calendar generation logic for the backend:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const moment = require('moment');

app.get('/calendar', async (req, res) => {
  const currentDate = moment();
  const startOfMonth = currentDate.clone().startOf('month');
  const endOfMonth = currentDate.clone().endOf('month');

  // Get all events for the current month
  const events = await Event.find({
    date: { $gte: startOfMonth.toDate(), $lte: endOfMonth.toDate() }
  });

  // Generate the calendar
  const daysInMonth = [];
  let day = startOfMonth.clone().startOf('week'); // Start the calendar from the first day of the week

  while (day.isBefore(endOfMonth, 'day')) {
    daysInMonth.push({
      date: day.clone(),
      events: events.filter(event => moment(event.date).isSame(day, 'day')) // Filter events for the day
    });
    day.add(1, 'day');
  }

  res.render('calendar', { daysInMonth });
});
This code generates the days for the current month and associates any events with the corresponding day.
